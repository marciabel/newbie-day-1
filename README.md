# Day 1/7 - QR code component solution

This is a solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H), and it's challenge 1/7 of my personal challenge "one newbie challenge a day" (more info in the [Continued development](#continued-development) section).

## My process
This one was quick and simple. The idea is to tackle seven newbie challenges in a week and get a good grasp using css variables and different display options. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was my first time using CSS variables, as well as using BEM notation for some of the elements on the page:

```html
<div class="main-container">
    <img src="images/image-qr-code.png" alt="" class="main-container__image">
    <h1 class="main-container__title">...</h1>
    <p class="main-container__text">...</p>
  </div>
```

### Continued development

For the next week, I'll be completing one newbie-level challenge a day, to get some practice with the basics and then move on to advanced topics. 

### Useful resources

- [Mozilla CSS Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - As always, a great resource.
